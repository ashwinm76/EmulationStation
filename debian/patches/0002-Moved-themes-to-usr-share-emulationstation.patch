 There are two places ES can load theme sets from:
 * `[HOME]/.emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
-* `/etc/emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
+* `/usr/share/emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
 
 `[SYSTEM_THEME]` is the `<theme>` tag for the system, as defined in `es_systems.cfg`.  If the `<theme>` tag is not set, ES will use the system's `<name>`.

 Fonts:
-Users can use any font they would like with the theme. Just copy your font to /etc/emulationstation/themes/carbon/art folder. Rename the original font "Cabin-Bold.ttf" to "Cabin-Bold.ttf.backup" and then rename your font to "Cabin-Bold.ttf". This will have the theme use your font instead of what comes with Carbon.

 Gamelist Font Size:
 To change the font size of the Gamelist, open the "carbon.xml" with a text editor, look for the tag <gamelist> and find a tag inside called <fontSize>. The original value is 0.03. A small change makes a big difference in size. If you want smaller gamelist names, try 0.02. If you want larger, try 0.04. You can even go further by trying 0.015.
